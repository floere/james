This is the directory for contributed examples.

They should always be of the form:

<pre><code>  # If using the gem, replace with:
  #
  # require 'rubygems'
  # require 'james'
  require File.expand_path '../../lib/james', __FILE__

  class ItunesDialogue

    include James::Dialogue

    # You dialogue definitions go here.

  end

  # This line is for running it standalone.
  #
  James.listen</code></pre>

One example is the following simple one:

<pre><code>  # If using the gem, replace with:
  #
  # require 'rubygems'
  # require 'james'
  require File.expand_path '../../lib/james', __FILE__

  class ItunesDialogue

    include James::Dialogue

    def initialize
      # Usually though it's a good idea to set it up in the actions:
      # @setup_thing ||= Thing.new
      # @setup_thing.do_something
      #
      @setup_thing = Thing.new
    end

    hear 'My useful initial phrase' => :my_initial_state
    state :my_initial_state do
      hear 'something'                   => :next_state
      hear 'something and stay in state' => ->(){ "I am saying this but staying in this state" }
      into do
        "Say something on entering"
      end
      exit do
        "Say something on exiting"
      end
    end

  end

  # This line is for running it standalone.
  #
  James.listen</code></pre>
